ANDROID MESSENGER APPLICATION.

OVERVIEW.
Project Background and Description.
Following the pandemic that swept the globe in recent years, a lot of us found ourselves confined to our homes unable to attend work, school and college.
In such times it becomes imperative that we find a reliable and secure way to stay connected. The Android Messenger app lets users log in to the 
system and stay connected with their loved ones without having to use their phone number or e-mail ID. All the user needs to have is an android 
smartphone and a connection to the internet.  This app keeps the personal details of its users safe and not compromised. Users can also edit their 
profile and change their password anytime.

Project Scope.
In this system, Users will be able to chat with each other. Users will have to create an account and login into the system.
Users can also search and chat with any users who are registered into the system. It is a purely chat-based application and cannot add any attachments. 
Users will get a notification for message received.
This is an Android based application system accessible through smartphones, i-pad's and laptops.
